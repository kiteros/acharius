        Data protection :
        	-All the data that I give to AchariusLab can’t be used for targeted advertaisment, data reselling, or any other activity where your data goes out of the closed circle of AchariusLab. However, we are allowed to used your data in a statistical way : for demographics about the number of user of AchariusLab and its evolution, but we can’t use it in a personalized way, where your name or other private information would be used.
        	-None of the data I did not gave to AchariusLab, except your ip adress, is stored in our database. Your ip adress is stored just to facilitate your connection and secure the website from unauthorized connexions.
        	-Your email adress will be used to send you informations about your own accounts, the problem it encounters, the payments receipt, or just to notify you that your command has been expedied. It can also be used, if you agree so, as a mean of promotion for the new developpments on our website. Of course, if you did not sign up for news and update, you won’t receive this kind of email. Moreover, if you do receive non wanted emails, you can resign at any moment from the email list.
        	-The user has the full potential to delete his account if his wants so, and the processus to do so is to go to user profile -> advanced parameters -> delete account. AchariusLab will completely delete any trace of you on our servers if you want to quit us.
        	-All the sensitive personal information stored in our server, for now only the user password, is crypted before being stored (hashing crypting). That means that at no time your password will transit in a non crypted form, thus creating vulnerabilities.
        	-All your data is fully protected in our secure servers, and in the unlikely event of a loss of data, accidentaly or intentionally, we will fully reinburse the damages thus created.

        Rules of parcel ownership :

        	-Owning a full parcel or a slot, is in no way meant to be used for an other usage than what AchariusLab can offer to you, that is to know plant growing. Owning a parcel or a slot doesn’t mean that you own this parcel in a private way, like you would own the terrain where you built your house. The user, is completely free, to do whatever he wants with his plant, but if his actions are endanging the other plants or the system as a whole, an automatic program will stop him from doing it. A user can’t be blamed for doing badly intentionated moves in a cloud environnment, but should keep in mind that a error in the system coupled with a bad action could have disastrous consequenses inside our environment.
        -Any user that buy a parcel, owns it until the parcel validity time is over. This time is often written on the purchase page of the parcel, and ought to be respected. If you want to renew your validity time, you can purchase some additional time for 50% off.
        -When your validity time is over and you did not purchased any additional time, and that your plant is still alive, you will have the choice either to harvest your plant within a few days, or to shut down your parcel. Your parcel will thus be reattribued to someone else.

        Shipping and reinbursment :

        	-When shipping time arrive, we will assure ourselves that your plant is in the best conditions to survive the trip, and arrive at your place within the best delays. The packaging is designing specifically depending on the kind of plant transported. Any phisical damage, rotting, or wrong plant delivered, will be fully reinbursed by ourselves.
